# io_anim_heavy_iron_studios
A Blender Addon for importing ANIM files by Heavy Iron Studios.

## Information for Users

This addon can only import animations, not models.

For model import, please use [DragonFF](https://github.com/Parik27/DragonFF) by Parik27.

### Features

- [x] Import animations
- [x] Multiple import possible
- [ ] Export animations (I'm working on it)

### Known Bugs

- Before you import an animation, make sure you have reset Rotation and Location of every bone in Pose Mode. You do this by selecting all bones in pose mode and pressing Alt+R and Alt+G
